# Pi 5 EEPROM / boot prep

Firmware setup for each Pi 5 node before installing the OS. Goal: every board boots the same way, no matter which EEPROM
version it shipped with.

## What we're doing

- Build one reusable SD card that reflashes each Pi's bootloader EEPROM with a known config.
- That config sets boot order (SD first, NVMe fallback) and forces a PCIe probe.
- The script always picks the latest stable bootloader binary from the official repo, so flashing the card also
  updates every board to the same known firmware version, regardless of what it shipped with.
- Once the EEPROM is flashed, the card's job is done.

Two separate layers, don't conflate them:

- EEPROM (firmware): boot order, PCIe detection. Set once via the SD card. OS-agnostic.
- config.txt (OS): PCIe runtime enable, link speed, cgroups. Lives in the OS image on the NVMe.
  - OSes like Talos bake these in, so nothing to do there if using those.

## Why a custom card instead of the Pi Imager preset

- Imager's "NVMe/USB Boot" preset works, but it writes a fixed config: no way to add `PCIE_PROBE` or choose the boot
  order.
- Building our own image lets us set exactly what we want and write down the exact values. Reproducible.
- Also pins every board to the same known EEPROM version.

## The settings

`BOOT_ORDER=0xf461` -> SD -> NVMe -> USB -> loop

- Tries SD first; if there's no bootable card, falls through to NVMe.
- SD-first on purpose: we can always drop in a card to recover or override a node.

`PCIE_PROBE=1` -> force the bootloader to probe PCIe

- The RS-P11 isn't a HAT+ board (no ID EEPROM), so the firmware won't auto-probe PCIe and might not see
  the NVMe as a boot device.
- Forcing the probe fixes that. Harmless when not needed; worst case is a tiny boot delay if no drive is present.

> No power override needed: the Pi is fed through its own USB-PD port, which negotiates the full 5A on its own, so
> neither `PSU_MAX_CURRENT` (EEPROM) nor `usb_max_current_enable` (config.txt) is required. Power rationale: `01_hardware.md`.

## Why the card is reusable

- The image is named `pieeprom.bin` (not `.upd`). `recovery.bin` flashes the EEPROM, then stops without disabling the
  card.
- One card -> boot every node with it -> done.

## How to build the card

Script: `build-rpi5-eeprom-card.sh` (runs on macOS). What it does:

1. Clones the official `rpi-eeprom` repo.
2. Picks the newest stable Pi 5 (2712) bootloader image.
3. Dumps its config, sets `BOOT_ORDER` + `PCIE_PROBE`.
4. Re-embeds the config, makes the `.sig` (sha256 of the image).
5. Formats the SD as FAT32 and copies `recovery.bin` + `pieeprom.bin` + `pieeprom.sig`.

Build steps are safe to re-run. The format step prompts for the disk and a `YES` confirm before erasing.

## Per board

- Insert card, power on. NVMe doesn't need to be installed yet, this only touches the EEPROM.
- Fast green LED blink (green screen on HDMI) = success. Red + blink code = failure.
- Power off, pull the card, next board.

## Verify

- Boot any OS once: `vcgencmd bootloader_config` or `rpi-eeprom-config` -> confirm `BOOT_ORDER`, `PCIE_PROBE`, and EEPROM
  version. Record them.
- With NVMe installed: `lspci` and `dmesg | grep -iE 'pcie|aer'` -> confirm Gen 2 link, no AER errors.

## Then

- Flash the OS image to each NVMe via the USB adapter, slot it in, boot.
