# Wipes STATE + EPHEMERAL and the `u-longhorn` data user volume. Keeps BOOT/EFI/META,
# so nodes reboot straight to maintenance with no reflash. Wiping the data volumes too means no orphaned
# replica or DB data ever survives a reset. Recoverable state comes back from git via ArgoCD; the on-disk
# data is gone for good.
#
# Workers are reset first and must be back in maintenance before the control plane is touched. See the comment
# on the ordering below; getting it wrong strands a worker with no API and costs a physical reflash.
#
# Node state only. Off-cluster S3 backups are the platform repo's to tear down (`make s3-backup-destroy`
# there); this script never touches them, so a reset is always recoverable from those backups.
