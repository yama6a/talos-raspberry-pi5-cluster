# Talos: OS choice, custom NVMe image & cluster bring-up

OS for the cluster: Talos Linux. Immutable, API-managed, Kubernetes-only.
Talos has no official Pi 5 image, so the node image is built separately, in
[yama6a/talos-raspberry-pi5](https://github.com/yama6a/talos-raspberry-pi5).

The node list lives in `inventory.yaml`, one entry per node carrying its role, hardware type and image source.
This doc covers the three Pi 5 control-plane nodes; what differs for a worker, or for a node type with no custom
build, is [04_worker_nodes.md](04_worker_nodes.md). Two consequences to know here: `03c` iterates the whole
inventory and applies a control-plane or worker config per node, and `03e` resolves the installer image per node
rather than using one for the cluster, so a mixed-hardware cluster cannot be handed one architecture's image.

## Why Talos

- Whole node = one declarative config. Managed via `talosctl`. Everything-as-code without exception.
- Identical nodes. Same image on every board; what makes a node different is just its config (cluster bring-up, below).
- Atomic A/B upgrades + rollback via `talosctl upgrade`. No in-place mutation.
- Minimal attack surface. No shell, no SSH, ~12 host binaries. WiFi/Bluetooth/cron daemons aren't in the image at
  all.
- Kubernetes built in. PCIe, cgroups, link speed are all baked into the image. No manual `config.txt` wrangling like
  on Raspberry Pi OS.

## Trade-offs

- Talos ships no Pi 5 image; BCM2712 + RP1 needs drivers that only exist in the `raspberrypi/linux` fork.
- Upgrading Talos means a new image build, which is a separate repo and its own maintenance.
- API-only, no shell. A hung node gets rebooted, not SSH'd into.

## OSes considered

| OS / distro                                | Verdict                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Talos Linux                                | Chosen. Immutable, declarative, identical nodes, K8s built in.                                            |
| k3s on Ubuntu Server                       | Runner-up. 4K pages + cgroups out of the box, biggest community. But mutable, more moving parts.          |
| k3s / kubeadm on Raspberry Pi OS           | Two Pi-5 traps: manual cgroup `cmdline.txt` edit + 16K-page kernel (must switch to 4K). No gain headless. |
| k0s on Ubuntu                              | Lightest footprint, clean `k0sctl` spec. Smaller ecosystem; no real advantage over Talos here.            |
| NixOS + k3s                                | Fully declarative, closest rival to Talos. Steep Nix learning curve, smaller Pi 5 community.              |
| Flatcar / Fedora CoreOS / openSUSE MicroOS | Also immutable, but Pi 5 support is thinner/younger. Talos wins on the declarative side.                  |
| Harvester                                  | Not even close. Full HCI/KubeVirt stack, needs x86_64 and a lot of RAM.                                   |

## Where the image comes from

`metal-arm64` does not work on a Pi 5: it carries no Pi 5 boot chain (u-boot + BCM2712 device tree) at all. So
the image is built separately, in
[yama6a/talos-raspberry-pi5](https://github.com/yama6a/talos-raspberry-pi5): current Talos on a Raspberry Pi
kernel, with the boot chain and two system extensions baked in. That repo owns the build, the kernel decisions
and the release stream. This one is a consumer of its releases:

- `03a` flashes the release's raw disk image onto each NVMe, once per drive.
- `03e` upgrades running nodes to the release's installer image over the network.

`siderolabs/sbc-raspberrypi` does ship an `rpi_5` overlay now, and its kernel side is fine: vanilla carries the
Pi 5 NIC as of Linux 6.18 and stock Talos enables it. What it cannot do is boot from NVMe. It ships u-boot built
for the Pi 4, with no `brcm,bcm2712-pcie` driver, so u-boot cannot read the disk the firmware just loaded it
from. Tested on a node here: the upgrade applied cleanly, then the board went dark with no layer-2 presence at
all. These nodes boot from NVMe, so that is fatal. The evidence, the full audit of which of the custom build's
steps are still load-bearing, and the plan to retire it are in that repo's `docs/upstream.md` and
`FUTURE_WORK.md`.

## Versions

Every pin lives in the committed `versions.env`; Renovate opens PRs to bump them.

- Talos image (`TALOS_IMAGE_RELEASE`): which release of the image repo above, as
  `<talos version>-<build revision>`. `common.sh` derives `TALOS_VERSION` from the part before the dash, and
  that is the talosctl client version, the expected server version, and what `03c` and `03f` reason about.
  One pin, so the client can never drift from the image.
- Kubernetes (`KUBERNETES_VERSION`): the pin `03c` passes to `gen config` and `03f` upgrades to. Capped by
  the Talos release's own k8s default, so raise it only after bumping the image.

Merging a bump changes only `versions.env`. Applying it needs `03e`, and `03a` for a fresh drive.

## What's baked into the image

Decided and documented in the image repo. What matters on this cluster:

- 4K kernel pages, not the Pi defconfig's 16K, matching stock Talos `metal-arm64` and keeping all three nodes
  the same. Some storage software does not cope with 16K.
- System extensions `iscsi-tools` (iSCSI-based CSI drivers need `iscsid`) and `util-linux-tools` (`fstrim`).
- Built-in drivers that `03d` and a storage layer depend on: the Pi 5 watchdog (`BCM2835_WDT`), NVMe over PCIe
  (`PCIE_BRCMSTB`), the NIC (`MACB`), RP1 bring-up (`MFD_RP1`, `FIRMWARE_RP1`, ...), and
  `INET_DIAG_DESTROY`, which is what lets `nic-keeper` force-close sockets with `ss -K`.
- WiFi and Bluetooth disabled at the device-tree level, which is also why `03c` binds the VIP to
  `interface: end0` rather than `physical: true`.

## Upgrades

During first setup the NVMe is flashed once (`03a`). After that, Talos upgrades are atomic A/B over the
network with no reflash. Bump `TALOS_IMAGE_RELEASE` in `versions.env`, then run **`03e_talos_upgrade.sh`**,
which runs `talosctl upgrade --image "$INSTALLER_REF"` one node at a time. Re-run-safe: a node already on the
target image is a no-op. The image package is public, so nodes need no registry auth to pull it.

**Draining during the upgrade (why `03e` cordons/drains itself).** Talos's upgrade sequence cordons the node and
drains it (honoring the eviction API / PodDisruptionBudgets) before the reboot. Without the mitigations below
that drain *hangs*, on three pods it cannot gracefully evict, each for a different reason:

- A single-instance database: its operator's PDB is `minAvailable: 1`, so with one instance ANY eviction violates
  it. A hard block, unrelated to storage. An HA instance is fine: it switches over, and its PDB permits the
  eviction.
- A per-node storage engine: its PDB blocks the drain while the node holds a volume's LAST HEALTHY replica,
  meaning when a volume is already degraded. Common here, since the NICs are flaky so a replica is often down.
- A broker with no PDB and no finalizer, just slow to terminate (quorum preStop) and unable to reschedule (hard
  one-per-node anti-affinity on 3 nodes plus node-local storage), so Talos's bounded drain times out on it.

None of these can relocate, because of node-local storage, a per-node storage engine, or hard anti-affinity. So a
graceful drain can only kill them, and they come back on the same node after the reboot.

`03e` therefore takes the drain into its own hands, with native `kubectl`. Per node it:

1. Waits until every replicated store is healthy and in sync, if a hook says so (see below).
2. Cordons, runs a bounded graceful drain, then force-deletes any straggler so the node can always reboot.

Talos's own in-upgrade drain then finds an empty node and completes instantly. Usually. When step 2's graceful
drain times out, the force-delete that follows carries a 20s grace and returns before the pod is actually gone,
so Talos's drain can start on a node that still holds a terminating one and fail on it:

```
error when evicting pods/"instance-manager-..." -n "longhorn-system":
client rate limiter Wait returned an error: rate: Wait(n=1) would exceed context deadline
```

`03e` aborts there with the cluster untouched and the node uncordoned, so just re-run it: it skips the nodes
already done and the pod is long gone by then. If it recurs on the same node, raise `GRACEFUL_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`
so the polite drain finishes instead of escalating, rather than lowering `FORCE_GRACE`.

A storage layer that offers to drain replicas off the node first is deliberately left switched off: evicting and
rebuilding replicas elsewhere needs a spare node and is slow, which is exactly what times out on a 3-node,
2-replica layout. The health gate below is the lighter, self-correcting equivalent, because the storage layer
rebuilds a degraded volume onto the spare node on its own while we wait.

**The replication-health gate (run before draining *each* node).** A node reboot is a replication event for every
replicated store that has data on it, so before taking a node down `03e` blocks until they are all healthy *and* in
sync, which crucially also waits out the PREVIOUS node's post-reboot resync before we touch the next one.

What counts as healthy depends entirely on what the cluster runs, and this repo does not know that. So the gate is
`PRE_DRAIN_HEALTH_HOOK` in `.env`: any command that exits 0 once every replicated store is in sync and non-zero
otherwise. It gets `NODE` and `REPLICATION_HEALTH_TIMEOUT` in its environment, and `03e` polls it until it passes
or the timeout expires, then aborts naming nothing but the hook (re-run is idempotent, done nodes are no-ops).

Leave it empty and nothing gates the reboot. `03e` warns once per run rather than passing silently, because the
difference between "no replicated state" and "replicated state nobody is checking" is not something it can see.

A hook worth writing checks, at minimum:

- **Replicated volumes**: none degraded or rebuilding, so a reboot cannot take a volume's last healthy replica.
- **Database clusters**: the standby up and caught up, and no switchover or failover mid-flight, so we never
  reboot the node hosting a primary while its replacement is still catching up.
- **Quorum brokers**: full membership, so quorum survives taking one down.

etcd is deliberately NOT the hook's job. `talosctl upgrade` already refuses to reboot if it would break quorum,
and the `talosctl health` gate between nodes covers full quorum restore.

**Upgrading Kubernetes (separate from the OS).** The Talos OS version and the Kubernetes version upgrade independently.
`03f_k8s_upgrade.sh` updates the k8s control plane (`talosctl upgrade-k8s --to "$KUBERNETES_VERSION"`). So bump *only*
`KUBERNETES_VERSION` in `versions.env`, and then run `03f`. `KUBERNETES_VERSION` can't exceed the pinned Talos release's default
k8s version (its supported ceiling). So it is useful to always first bump Talos.

**Rebalancing after the upgrade (`03g`).** Draining node by node leaves the pods bunched on whichever nodes were
up last, and nothing moves them back: no descheduler, and `topologySpreadConstraints` are the workloads' own business.
`03g_rebalance_workloads.sh` rolling-restarts the stateless Deployments so the scheduler re-places them. `03e`
runs it; `make rebalance-workloads` runs it alone. A measured run went 39/40/15 to 31/32/32.

- A nudge, not guaranteed balance. The scheduler scores each pod alone, so a run can still clump. The real fix,
  if it ever matters, is `topologySpreadConstraints` on the workloads themselves.
- Refuses to run unless every node is Ready, schedulable, and the count matches `inventory.yaml`. Restarting while
  one is cordoned just packs the survivors.
- Serial, one Deployment at a time: `maxSurge` doubles a Deployment's pods and three Pi 5s are RAM-tight.
- Skips a Deployment when its namespace is in `REBALANCE_SKIP_NAMESPACES` (`.env`; typically the CSI driver's
  namespace, whose sidecars may be mid-volume-op, and the ingress data plane), when it mounts a PVC (not
  stateless, and moving it costs a detach/attach), or when it is scaled to 0. The PVC test is a property, not a
  name, so operator-generated names cannot rot a list.
- NOT wired into `03f`: `upgrade-k8s` rolls the control plane and kubelet in place and moves no pods.

## Flash the NVMe

Script: `03a_talos_image_flasher.sh` (MacOS). Downloads the pinned release's `.raw.xz`, checks its sha256
against the release's `sha256sums.txt`, then `dd`s it to an NVMe over a USB adapter. Cached per release tag,
so the second and third drives re-download nothing. Usual safeguards: lists disks, requires typing `YES`,
writes to `/dev/rdiskN`, ejects.

### Per drive

Run the script, pick the USB-NVMe adapter's disk id, confirm. Repeat for each SSD, just swap drives in the
adapter. Then slot the SSD into a Pi, power on with no SD card -> Talos boots into maintenance mode (no role
assigned yet).

## Boot & verify (per node)

Script: `03b_talos_boot_verify.sh`, checks EVERY node in `inventory.yaml` and runs the checklist below against
each (maintenance mode, `--insecure`), inspecting each output and printing PASS/FAIL + a summary. It uses the talosctl
container (sidesteps the MacOS gotcha below); `ping`/`nc` run natively.

```bash
./03b_talos_boot_verify.sh        # checks every node in inventory.yaml
```

What it checks per node:

```bash
ping <node-ip>                                       # on the network
nc -vz <node-ip> 50000                               # Talos API reachable
talosctl -n <node-ip> version --insecure             # responds; server = our (-dirty) custom build
talosctl -n <node-ip> get links --insecure           # end0 (the wired NIC) present/up
talosctl -n <node-ip> get disks --insecure           # the node's inventory installDisk present
talosctl -n <node-ip> get kernelcmdlines --insecure  # cmdline has console=ttyAMA0,115200 (rpi5 overlay)
```

All green -> proceed to [Cluster bring-up](#cluster-bring-up) below.

### MacOS `talosctl` gotcha

If `nc` succeeds but `talosctl ... --insecure` comes back with `no route to host`, the node is probably fine. The MacOS
`talosctl` binary is just misbehaving (confirmed by the official container reaching the same node without issues). Use
the container:

```bash
talosctl() { docker run --rm --network host -v "$HOME/.talos:/root/.talos" ghcr.io/siderolabs/talosctl:<TALOS_VERSION> "$@"; }  # match TALOS_VERSION in versions.env
```

Drop that in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`, reload, and `talosctl` works normally from there.

## Cluster bring-up

Per-node identity (hostname, role) is applied now via `talosctl`. By default (`DISABLE_FLANNEL_AND_KUBE_PROXY="true"`
in `.env`) the CNI is disabled at the Talos layer (`cni: none`) and kube-proxy is off (`proxy.disabled: true`), both
left for a CNI installed separately, which also takes over kube-proxy. All three nodes are control-plane and
schedulable. Nodes come up NotReady until that CNI lands, which is expected, not a fault.

Set `DISABLE_FLANNEL_AND_KUBE_PROXY="false"` instead and Talos keeps its built-in Flannel and kube-proxy, so the
cluster reaches Ready on its own with no CNI install. That gets you pod and service networking and nothing else: no
LoadBalancer, no L2 announcements, no gateway and no encryption, so a platform expecting any of those will not
deploy onto it unchanged. It is a bootstrap-time decision either way. Switching a live cluster between the two
means a rebuild, not a `make reapply-talos-config`.

> The cluster name and VIP live in `.env`; the node list, and each node's `installDisk`, live in `inventory.yaml`.
> Nothing is hardcoded in the script: edit both to match your hardware and network.

### Router reservations (manual, once)

Reserve one MAC/IP pair per Pi so each always boots at a known IP. My values:

| Node   | IP (my choice) |
|--------|----------------|
| talos-cp1 | 192.168.10.201 |
| talos-cp2 | 192.168.10.202 |
| talos-cp3 | 192.168.10.203 |

Boot the Pis one by one, read their MAC addresses from the router's client list, and add a reservation for each. (You
can do this with a standard PiOS image on an SD card first, or with the Talos image on the NVMe, as long as the Pi
boots, its MAC shows up and you can reserve the IP.)

The VIP is not reserved in the router: it must be outside the DHCP pool, Talos claims it via ARP, and it can move
between nodes, so it can't be pinned to a MAC. My subnet is `192.168.0.0/16` with DHCP `192.168.2.1`-`192.168.10.254`,
so I picked `192.168.100.1` for the VIP (inside the subnet, outside the DHCP range)

### Prereqs

- The nodes are all booted from NVMe and reachable in maintenance mode at their reserved IPs.
- Docker, with host networking enabled in Docker Desktop. The script runs `talosctl` as a pinned container, so no host
  `talosctl`/`kubectl` is required for bring-up.

### What `03c_talos_cluster_config.sh` does

1. Reads cluster name, EPHEMERAL cap, NIC and the VIP from `.env`, and each node's hostname, IP and install
   disk from `inventory.yaml`, prints a summary, and waits for a `YES` confirmation.
2. Prepares the config. The durable secrets bundle (`secrets.yaml`, the cluster PKI: CA, service-account
   key, bootstrap/join tokens) is generated **once** and never rotated, so the cluster identity survives every
   re-run and rebuild. Everything else is **disposable scratch re-rendered each run**: `talosctl gen config
   --with-secrets secrets.yaml --force` regenerates the base machine config from that bundle + the *current*
   `versions.env`/`.env` values, so a version bump in `versions.env` actually lands (unlike the old preserved `controlplane.yaml`,
   which froze the version it was first generated with). Kubernetes is pinned explicitly with
   `--kubernetes-version "$KUBERNETES_VERSION"` rather than taking the Talos release default, so the k8s
   version is a reviewed knob, not an implicit side effect of a Talos bump. A second `gen config
   --output-types worker` runs from the SAME `secrets.yaml` when the inventory has any worker, so the PKI
   matches; the API endpoint is the VIP either way. (The base defaults to Flannel; with
   `DISABLE_FLANNEL_AND_KUBE_PROXY="true"` the patch below turns the CNI off so a replacement can take over.) Migration note: the first run after this split, if only a
   pre-split `controlplane.yaml` exists, extracts `secrets.yaml` *from it* (`gen secrets
   --from-controlplane-config`) so the running cluster's existing PKI is preserved rather than replaced.
3. Applies a control-plane patch to every control-plane node: the VIP bound to the wired NIC,
   `allowSchedulingOnControlPlanes: true`, `certSANs` (VIP + the control-plane IPs), and the CNI pair driven by
   `DISABLE_FLANNEL_AND_KUBE_PROXY`: `cluster.network.cni.name` (`none` or `flannel`) and `cluster.proxy.disabled`.
   One switch drives both because they are not independent: Flannel does not replace kube-proxy, so `flannel` with
   the proxy disabled boots a healthy-looking cluster where no ClusterIP works. Plus `machine.features.kubePrism.enabled: true`
   (a local apiserver endpoint at `localhost:7445` that a CNI can use before pod networking exists; default-on in
   recent Talos, set explicitly here to document the dependency).
   Finally it raises etcd's timeouts (`cluster.etcd.extraArgs: {heartbeat-interval: "500", election-timeout: "5000"}`),
   5x etcd's 100ms/1000ms defaults. All three nodes are control-plane + worker and etcd shares the single NVMe with
   the storage layer and any databases, so during the cold-boot I/O storm etcd's fsyncs stall past the default 1000ms
   election window and trigger a burst of spurious leader elections, which disrupts apiserver watches and lags every
   controller behind them. The 5s election timeout rides out the stalls. The only cost is ~5s instead of ~1s failover
   when a leader really is gone, which does not matter on this cluster.
4. Appends the partition layout: `EPHEMERAL` capped (default 64 GiB) + a `storage` user volume taking the whole
   rest of the NVMe (`/var/mnt/storage`, no `maxSize`, so it claims what is left once at provision time). That
   path also gets a `kubelet.extraMounts` bind, `rshared`, so the containerized kubelet can see it and so a CSI
   driver's per-volume sub-mounts propagate back to the host. It sits empty until a storage layer is installed.
   Talos provisions a volume ONCE, so renaming it later orphans the partition rather than renaming it.
5. `apply-config` to each node, with a per-NODE patch on top of the per-ROLE one: `machine.install.image` from
   `installer_ref_for` (so each hardware type gets the installer it is built from) and the node label
   `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type=<type>` from its inventory `type`, which is what the `nic-keeper` DaemonSet
   selects on, see [Runtime: the recovery DaemonSet](#runtime-the-recovery-daemonset-nic-keeper). Then
   deletes the rendered scratch (`cp.yaml`,
   `controlplane.yaml`, and their inputs `cp-patch.yaml` + `volumes.yaml`), so the nodes now hold their own
   live config, so the only config left on disk is the durable `secrets.yaml` (plus the
   `talosconfig`/`kubeconfig` creds). On an apply failure the script aborts before the cleanup, leaving the
   files for inspection.
6. Waits for every node to reboot back into its configured state (polls the secure Talos API per node, up to 5 min
   each), so the bootstrap prompt only appears once the nodes are actually ready, no guessing.
7. `bootstrap` etcd once on the first node (after a confirm); the others join automatically.
8. Waits for health, writes `kubeconfig`.

### Run

```bash
make init-talos                        # every node must be in MAINTENANCE mode
make add-node NODE=<host>              # or: one node, into a cluster that is already running
make reapply-talos-config [NODE=...]   # or: push a config change to nodes already running
```

Values come from `.env`, `versions.env` and `inventory.yaml`; review the printed summary before continuing.
After `apply-config` the nodes reboot and the script waits for each to come back (polling the secure API), so
there is no manual stopwatch.

The three entry points differ ONLY in how the same render is applied:

| | nodes must be | applies | bootstraps etcd |
|---|---|---|---|
| `make init-talos` | ALL in maintenance | `--insecure` | yes, once |
| `make add-node NODE=` | that one in maintenance | `--insecure` | no, it joins on its own |
| `make reapply-talos-config` | already RUNNING | authenticated, `--mode auto` | no |

That is why `init-talos` cannot be used to change a running cluster: it waits for maintenance mode and dies
after 300s per node. `--reapply` is the path for a live change, and it dry-runs and asks first. What it CANNOT
change is volume geometry: Talos provisions a volume once and, with `grow` unset as it is here, "the existing
volume size is never changed", so an `EPHEMERAL_SIZE` edit reaches new nodes only.

> Bootstrap runs on one node only. Never re-run it on another node, or you split etcd into two clusters.

### Verify

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./secrets/kubeconfig
kubectl get nodes -o wide                  # 3x NotReady, no CNI yet; flips to Ready once one is installed
talosctl -n <cp1-ip> etcd members          # 3 members
```

## Then: NIC hardening

Once the cluster is up (nodes NotReady, no CNI yet), `03d_nic_hardening.sh` applies both halves of the `macb`
mitigation: the machine-config defences (`EthernetConfig` + `WatchdogTimerConfig`) and the `nic-keeper`
DaemonSet. See [NIC hardening](#nic-hardening-the-macb-wedge).

It runs before a CNI is installed, deliberately, so the NIC is hardened ahead of the network-heavy CNI
rollout. The DaemonSet lands fine at that point: the DaemonSet controller tolerates
`node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`, and the pod is `hostNetwork`, so it needs no pod network.

Installing a CNI is what flips the nodes to Ready, and it is the first thing to happen after this repo is
done. That, and everything above it, is out of scope here.

## NIC hardening: the macb wedge

The Pi 5 `macb` NIC wedges ([sbc-raspberrypi #91](https://github.com/siderolabs/sbc-raspberrypi/issues/91)).
A newer kernel does not fix it; the mitigation is config/runtime. Three triggers, and
the defence for each:

| macb trigger                    | defence                                                    | where                  |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|

### `03d_nic_hardening.sh` (implemented now)

Fully automated, idempotent, safe to re-run. Reuses the dockerized `talosctl` + `kubectl`
and `secrets/` from cluster bring-up.

```bash
./03d_nic_hardening.sh
```

What it does:

1. Nodes from the talosconfig endpoints (`talosctl config info`); maps IP -> k8s node name.
2. Discovers the NIC facts instead of hardcoding them. Rings (pre-set max) and the exact
   offload feature keys come from Talos's own `EthernetStatus` resource. These are the
   kernel netdev names `EthernetConfig` accepts (e.g. `tx-tcp-segmentation`,
   `tx-generic-segmentation`, `rx-gro`), which differ from `ethtool -k`'s umbrella names.
   A temporary privileged probe pod (hostNetwork, pinned to one node, `kube-system`) reads
   only what has no resource: EEE controllability (`ethtool --show-eee`, captured for the
   deferred DaemonSet, not applied) and the watchdog device.
3. Generates the config: `EthernetConfig` (rings = discovered max; the settable,
   non-`[fixed]` TSO/GSO/GRO keys -> `false`) + `WatchdogTimerConfig` (discovered device;
   timeout clamped to `[10s, ~Pi-max]`).
4. Applies to every node with `talosctl patch mc --patch @... --mode no-reboot`, a
   document-level strategic merge that leaves `v1alpha1` untouched (so the live certSAN
   fix is preserved); never a full re-apply, never a reboot. `EthernetConfig` is
   delete-then-readd so its `features` map is authoritative each run (see caveats).
5. Verifies against the authoritative resources, per node, polled (the apply is async):
   `EthernetStatus` -> offloads off + rings at max; `WatchdogTimerStatus` -> armed with the
   set timeout. It never triggers the watchdog.
6. Waits for the network to settle. The `EthernetConfig` ring-resize re-inits the `macb`
   rings, which bounces `end0`'s link for a few seconds, and the control-plane VIP rides on
   `end0`. The verify in (5) only proves the config landed (`talosctl` hits node IPs directly),
   not that the VIP is reachable again; that blip is exactly what made a following CNI
   install hit `dial 192.168.100.1:6443: network is unreachable`. So before exiting, 03d polls the
   apiserver over the VIP (`kubectl get --raw=/readyz`) and requires `SETTLE_STREAK` (default 5)
   consecutive OKs within `SETTLE_WAIT` (default 60s); one success isn't enough (a single good
   hit is not enough). A non-steady API fails the step, so a bootstrap aborts here instead of
   cascading a confusing failure into whatever runs next.
7. Cleans up the probe pod.

Reading the output: `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` per check, then `summary: N passed, M failed`.
Exit 0 = all green. A `[FAIL]` on `patch` mentioning reboot means the change wanted a
reboot (it refused), investigate before forcing. A watchdog `[FAIL]` usually means the
timeout exceeded the hardware max, lower `WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT`. A `[FAIL]` on the settle check
means the VIP/API didn't steady within `SETTLE_WAIT`, let the NIC/control-plane settle (or raise
`SETTLE_WAIT`) before installing a CNI, rather than pushing on into a flaky API.

### Runtime: the recovery DaemonSet (`nic-keeper`)

The three triggers below have no `EthernetConfig` field and need a live agent, so runtime recovery
cannot live in machine config. That agent is `nic-keeper`, one DaemonSet pod per rpi5 node
(namespace `kube-system`, hostNetwork), defined in `lib/k8s/nic-keeper.yaml` and applied by `03d`
right after the machine-config half.

It lands before any CNI exists, which is the point: the DaemonSet controller tolerates
`node.kubernetes.io/not-ready` so its pods are placed on NotReady nodes, and the pod is
`hostNetwork`, so it needs no pod network. Both halves of the mitigation are therefore in place
ahead of the network-heavy CNI rollout, which is what `03d` runs early to protect.

The three runtime `macb` failure modes machine-config can't reach (the other two are `03d`'s, see
the [table above](#nic-hardening-the-macb-wedge)):

| runtime trigger                    | what happens                                                    | defence                                       |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| EEE LPI-wake race                  | link wakes from low-power idle too slowly, drops frames         | assert `ethtool --set-eee end0 eee off`       |
| silent wedge                       | link stays up, carrier fine, but no traffic passes              | active ping probe -> bounce `ip link` down/up |
| post-recovery kubelet socket stall | kubelet's old TCP sockets to the API server hang after a bounce | `ss -K` drops them so they reconnect          |

On each node the single consolidated loop:

1. Asserts the NIC's power-saving mode off on start, and after every bounce, since a bounce can re-enable it.
2. Probes link health every `CHECK_INTERVAL` (5s): pings the default gateway and reads
   `/sys/class/net/end0/carrier`. The ping is the real signal, because a wedge keeps carrier up, so
   carrier alone misses it.
3. On `FAIL_THRESHOLD` (4) consecutive failures: `ip link set end0 down` -> brief sleep -> `up`,
   re-assert EEE off, `ss -K dport = :6443` to drop stale API-server sockets, then honours
   `COOLDOWN` (60s) before probing again (anti-flap).

One structured stdout line per event (`<ts> nic-keeper iface=end0 event=<name> ...`). The loop
script is the ConfigMap in `lib/k8s/nic-keeper.yaml` (mounted + exec'd), and every knob is a plain
assignment in its `# ---- knobs ----` block.

| Applied by `03d`, not delivered | it is the other half of what `03d` already does, and it has to be up before the CNI rollout. Nothing reconciles it, so an image bump or a knob edit needs a `make harden-nics` to land. |
| `instance-type: rpi5` selector | the macb wedge is Pi 5-only. Stamped by Talos `machine.nodeLabels` in [`03c`](#what-03c_talos_cluster_configsh-does), from that node's `type` in `inventory.yaml`; that key works because it's on the kubelet NodeRestriction allowlist (an arbitrary `kubernetes.io/*` label is rejected by admission). Not `os: linux` (too broad) nor `control-plane:DoesNotExist` (every node here is control-plane -> matches zero nodes). |

Caveats / preconditions:

- Kernel: older Pi 5 kernels can't toggle EEE; the loop logs `event=eee-unsupported` and keeps
  running the link-watchdog. The custom image already ships a new-enough kernel (see [the build](#the-build)).
- `CONFIG_INET_DIAG_DESTROY` is required for `ss -K`; absent, the loop logs `event=ss-k-unsupported`
  once and skips the socket-drop (link bounce + EEE still run).
- A brief link bounce (~2s, `LINK_DOWN_SECONDS`) is expected on every recovery.
- Never trips the `03d` hardware watchdog: every action is short and the loop always makes progress
  (no unbounded waits).
- Thresholds are tunable in the knobs block (`CHECK_INTERVAL`, `FAIL_THRESHOLD`, `LINK_DOWN_SECONDS`,
  `COOLDOWN`, `SS_KILL_FILTER`, `PING_TARGET`). The agent only ever touches `IFACE` (`end0`).
- Editing the loop script does not restart the pods by itself, so `03d` compares the ConfigMap's
  resourceVersion across the apply and rolls the DaemonSet only when it actually changed.

Verify:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=./secrets/kubeconfig
kubectl get ds -n kube-system nic-keeper                           # DESIRED = CURRENT = READY = 3
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nic-keeper   # one pod per node; event=eee-off ok
kubectl get nodes -L node.kubernetes.io/instance-type              # all three show rpi5
```

A recovery, in the affected node's pod logs:

```
... event=probe-fail target=192.168.10.1 carrier=1 count=4/4
... event=wedge fail_count=4 threshold=4 carrier=1 (bouncing link)
... event=ss-kill filter='dport = :6443' result=...
... event=recovery link bounced + eee re-asserted; cooldown=60s
```

> Live cluster (label not yet present): if the cluster predates the `03c` change, stamp the label
> without a reboot the same way `03d` patches config:
>
`talosctl -n <node-ip> patch mc --mode no-reboot --patch '{"machine":{"nodeLabels":{"node.kubernetes.io/instance-type":"rpi5"}}}'`
> (repeat per node). Otherwise the DaemonSet has nothing to schedule onto.

### Caveats

- Feature keys are kernel netdev names, not `ethtool -k` names. `EthernetConfig`
  (and `EthernetStatus`) use `tx-tcp-segmentation` / `tx-generic-segmentation` / `rx-gro`,
  not the umbrella `tcp-segmentation-offload` etc. Talos accepts a wrong key but it
  fails the whole ethtool reconcile (`bit name not found`), so every offload silently
  stays on. `03d` sources the keys from `EthernetStatus` to avoid this; don't hand-edit.
- `features` map is replaced, not merged. Strategic merge unions maps, so a stale or
  renamed key would linger and break the reconcile. `03d` deletes the `EthernetConfig`
  document (`$patch: delete`) then re-adds it, authoritative + idempotent each run.
- Discovered, not hardcoded: ring max + the watchdog device/timeout ceiling are
  driver/hardware-specific (Pi `bcm2712` watchdog max ~15s; Talos min 10s), `03d` reads
  them live and clamps.
- certSAN-preserving apply: only `talosctl patch mc` (document merge). Never
  `apply-config`/full replace, which would clobber the live certSAN fix.
- `kube-system` PSS exemption: Talos applies Pod Security elsewhere; the privileged
  probe pod runs in `kube-system`, which is exempt.
- Image: the recent kernel that makes EEE controllable comes from the image repo; the EEE
  step itself is in the deferred DaemonSet, not the image.

## Troubleshooting

Image build:

- Problems building the image live in its own repo, see
  [docs/build.md](https://github.com/yama6a/talos-raspberry-pi5/blob/main/docs/build.md).

Flash:

- `download failed` -> `TALOS_IMAGE_RELEASE` names a release that does not exist. Check the image repo's
  releases page.
- `checksum mismatch` -> a truncated download. Delete `.cache/images/<release>/` and re-run.

Boot:

- Node never appears on the network -> kernel is missing RP1 NIC support, or the overlay/u-boot didn't land on the
  EFI partition (offline validation catches the latter). Attach HDMI or a USB-UART serial console (115200 baud,
  `ttyAMA10`) to see what's happening.
- Won't boot at all -> EEPROM boot order / `PCIE_PROBE` (step 02).
- NVMe not detected -> PCIe probe / `dtparam`; confirm Gen 2 link with step 02's checks.
- Node is gone for good and needs replacing -> [05_node_recovery.md](05_node_recovery.md). Do NOT re-run `03c`
  as-is: it ends by bootstrapping etcd, which is for creating a cluster, not rejoining one.
